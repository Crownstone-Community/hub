# CloudLink

This module will listen to the SSE messages from the cloud and switch Crownstones accordingly via the Bluenet Module.

It will also be tasked with keeping an up-to-date copy of all data it requires from the Crownstone Cloud.

It will communicate with Mongo via Loopback to persist important data.
